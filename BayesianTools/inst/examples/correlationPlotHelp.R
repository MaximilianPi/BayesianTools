## Generate a test likelihood function. 
ll <- generateTestDensityMultiNormal(sigma = "no correlation")

## Create a BayesianSetup object from the likelihood 
## is the recommended way of using the runMCMC() function.
bayesianSetup <- createBayesianSetup(likelihood = ll, lower = rep(-10, 3), upper = rep(10, 3))

## Finally we can run the sampler and have a look
settings = list(iterations = 1000)
out <- runMCMC(bayesianSetup = bayesianSetup, sampler = "DEzs", settings = settings)

## Correlation density plots:
correlationPlot(out)

## text to display correlation will be not scaled to the strength of the correlation
correlationPlot(out, scaleCorText = FALSE) 

## We can also switch the method for calculating correllations
correlationPlot(out, scaleCorText = FALSE, method = "spearman")
